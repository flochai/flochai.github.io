🌱 Week in Review – My First Real Arch Linux & Kubernetes Adventure

This week has been one of those “learn by almost breaking everything” kind of weeks. I went deep into the Arch Linux rabbit hole — and somehow came out the other side with a running Hyprland desktop. I also had fights with cloudflared tunnels for my homelab. Here’s a breakdown of what I tackled (and occasionally fumbled).

⸻

🖥️ Installed Arch Linux… and Actually Made It Boot

After spending 3 hours trying to make a boot SD for my Pi, I realized that PI and Arch are not friends... Some partitioning drama later and trying to figure out why /boot was a black hole of nothingness, I finally got Arch installed on an old MSI laptop I had lying around.

I set up LUKS encryption, LVM, a separate /home (which I forgot to mount), and got GRUB working (eventually). First boot felt like a small miracle. Then I dove into Hyprland, played around with the wayland bar and hyperlock screen.

☁️ Cloudflare Tunnel + K8s

I realised, thanks to a fellow @kubecraft engineer that I had some sensitive tunnel data in a commit history so I had to create a new cloudflare tunnel and break my skull trying to reconnect it. After multiple recreations, I understood that creating a secret using --from-file and --from-literal makes a difference in the way that kubernetes handles the file in the pod.

The tunnel now routes traffic to linkding, a self-hosted bookmark manager.

Also learned:

•	DNS in K8s can silently fail after a reboot if you’re not careful (my resolv.conf magically changed from beautiful ipv4s to ipv6 which of course threw everything into a hissy fit)
•	--with-source in Flux is not just a cute flag.
•	And reconcile stuck is its own special flavor of pain.

🤯 Final Thought

Setting up a tiling Wayland desktop environment on Arch and trying to upgrade my homelab Kubernetes cluster may not have been the wisest combo for one week… but hey, I learned a ton. If you’re curious or want to try something similar, feel free to check out my dotfiles repo — PRs and suggestions welcome.

Until next week — go with the Flo 🚀
