This week marks the beginning of my journey into the clouds with AWS. There has been some turbulence!

Through my DataScientest DevOps course, I have access to 4 days of training, which include the prep for the Cloud Practitioner in-person training and the Solutions Architect in-person training. I did the Cloud Practitioner training on Monday — it went well, although it all feels like having a bucket of information (or 20) offloaded on my head. On Monday evening, the trainer suddenly announced he had to go to the hospital, which marked the end of the training week very prematurely.

At first, I was quite upset because I had been looking forward to this week since the beginning of the course in March. But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Due to the ‘incident,’ the school gave us all premium AWS Skill Builder accounts for a year — but most importantly, we got access to 3 AWS vouchers: the original Cloud Practitioner and SAA exam vouchers and a third voucher of our choice. I guess I’ll be taking the Solutions Architect Pro for free in a few months. So, I followed the plan I had set for next week, which was to go through the Adrian Cantrill SAA course to prepare for the exam, since 3 days of presentations is definitely not enough from what I’ve heard.

So far, I’ve logged 32 hours on the SAA Adrian Cantrill course. This funny and compassionate-to-the-animal-cause man is quite a great pedagogue and manages to make the wall of ice (secret reference to S3 Glacier here) digestible. There are sooooo many different things to know, and I’ve written about 50 to 60 pages of notes in Obsidian, focusing on IAM and S3 so far. I really appreciate how Adrian covers more than just exam content and clearly points out what’s important to remember for the test: red highlighter here please!

Alongside the adventure in the Amazon, I’ve continued my Linux journey. I felt like the LFCS training I started didn’t cover a few basic points I could use more practice with — such as the core concepts of how it all works — so I went shopping for more. The KodeKloud Linux Basics 5-hour course is what I ended up with, and it is phenomenal. Even though it’s aimed at total beginners, the story format (inspired by books like The Phoenix Project, which I’m now reading as well) and the extensive information helped me learn a bunch of new elements, along with reviewing ones I already knew. The beginning story parts are a bit long and might make you think this is cheesy, but once you get to the video explaining how the kernel works, it starts getting REALLY good. Here’s a note I took from the kernel explanation (rewritten in my own words but using their metaphor):

The kernel is like a librarian in a university. It keeps track of all the books borrowed, sends alerts to students when they need to return books, and makes sure students borrow the correct ones and don’t take more than allowed. Without the librarian, it would be total chaos.

Even though I totaled exactly 40 hours of study this week (32 AWS and 8 Linux), I feel like I’m moving slowly. Maybe this is the aftermath of the CKAD results high.
