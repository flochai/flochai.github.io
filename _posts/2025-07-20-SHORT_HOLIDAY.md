Being a godfather to a little girl called Teodora meant that this week I had some duties in Novi Sad, Serbia, and therefore a little holiday was in store for us. My wife, my two daughters, and I definitely needed a change of scenery! We spent 4 days in the tech city of Serbia, and ironically, I worked much less on my tech. We walked around the old town, ate local foods such as roštilj (BBQ) and cakes, and spent quite a bit of time (TOO MUCH) in the malls. But my wife and daughters were happy, so it was a win.

In all of that, I still managed to put in about 10 hours on the Adrian Cantrill SAA course and learned a lot about EC2. I particularly enjoyed exploring the different ways to automate instance creation with CFN or AMI baking. The way that we go from using user-data as a launch config to the way more versatile cfn-init is quite interesting as it teaches limitations and how they were developed into more robust systems. I also notice a lot of similarities between AWS and Kubernetes such as the store manager (basically config maps and secret for AWS) or of course the way clusters are run. The course is great, but that percentage ticker is soooo slow… so much information to take in!

Right, a short post for this week since not much work was done. I hope you’re also taking some much-deserved rest this summer!
