Normally this is a Sunday writeup, but I HAD to wait for the results of the CKAD exam I passed this weekend to let you all know the (pfiouu good…) news.

Saturday, the 2 hour exam went by like a breeze. Quickly and surely but certainly not calmly. Then followed the stress stomach ball for 24 hours...even though I knew I passed, I had a doubt and waiting 24 hours for the results was tough. There must be a lot of people going for it these days, I thought results would be here faster.

Really happy about my score of 87%. I enjoyed passing the exam a lot even though I felt quite a lot of stress while I passed it. I was surprised to find some questions on subjects that I had not seen at all before even though I did the excellent Mumshad Mannambeth course as well as the 10 KodeKloud mock exams a few times each. Some resource aspects were totally new to me although the lifesaving Kubernetes doc helped me find the solution relatively easily. Also discovered a new flag during the exam, thanks to the -h. Final surprising point for me, I don't know if it's done on purpose or if it was just me but the documentation page was very laggy and slow for me, specifically when scrolling (CLI perfect). So, I used the search function in pages a lot and relied a bit more on -h.

To take a little breather from the 20+ mock exams I did during the weekdays, I also went through the first module of the LCFS course on Kodekloud to learn how to be more efficient in Linux. It was educational to practice using the archiving and zipping functions, searching with egrep and find, realizing regex was going to be another one of those (useful) rabbit holes and many other Linux related goodies. I definitely still have a lot to learn but my progress is motivating me very much and I sense a love story building here.

Finally, today was my first of four days of AWS SAA training with Davy, my instructor. I feel like a few buckets (get it?) were just dropped on me because of the baffling volume of various nomenclatures zooming left and right…I guess I know what the goals for this month is. Grinding Elastics…
