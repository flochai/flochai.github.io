# Leveling Up: My Kubernetes Journey — From KCNA to GitOps 🍥🚀

It’s been a pretty packed week as you can see below...

---

## ✅ Passed the KCNA 🎓

I kicked things off by passing the **KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate)** certification.  
The KCNA was a great entry point — not too intimidating, but definitely a solid test of fundamentals: architecture, containers, networking, security, and all the CNCF buzzwords.
I found the networking parts a bit chalenging, I must study and practice it more.

A huge thanks to the Kubecraft community, James Spurin’s Udemy course, and basically everyone on the internet who dropped tips and cheat sheets. Couldn’t have done it without you.

## ✅ Datascientest Kubernetes Project

As part of my ongoing course, I built my first Kubernetes project for the **Datascientest exam**.  
It was a great chance to apply what I learned:
- Designing simple deployments
- Creating services
- Playing with Ingress
- Understanding PVCs and volumes

👉 Nothing beats actually breaking things and fixing them.

## ✅ Raspberry Pi Homelab Setup (a.k.a. Floki) 🖥🍓

I finally set up my little Kubernetes cluster using a **Raspberry Pi** running **K3s**.

- Installed K3s
- Enabled SSH access from my MacBook (after some “fun” with IP addresses)
- Configured everything headless — no screen, no keyboard, just pure terminal zen.

> Spoiler: when you finally `ssh pi@192.168.x.x` and it works — best feeling ever.

## ✅ GitOps with Flux 🌀

After a bit of initial chaos deploying stuff manually, I made the jump to **GitOps** using **Flux**.  
Flux watches my GitHub repo, and any change I push gets automatically deployed to the cluster.

👉 This already feels like real-world DevOps work:
- version control
- reproducibility
- rollback safety
- and zero “what did I change last Thursday?” moments.

## ✅ Deployed My First App: Linkding 📚

I wanted to try deploying something actually useful, so I set up **Linkding**, a self-hosted bookmark manager.

- Deployed it inside my cluster
- Exposed it via Ingress
- And because I like to live dangerously — made it accessible remotely.

---

## ✅ Exposed Linkding via Cloudflare Tunnel ☁️🌐

Rather than opening firewall ports or dealing with complicated reverse proxies, I used a **Cloudflare Tunnel** to expose Linkding securely to the internet.

Honestly, this setup is brilliant:
- No port forwarding
- No public IP needed
- Built-in free SSL

Highly recommend it for fellow homelabbers who want simple & safe external access.

## ✅ Started the CKAD Journey 🎯

Now that KCNA is behind me, I started preparing for the **CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)**.

I'm following the legendary **Mumshad Mannambeth** course on Udemy.  
After just a few modules:
- Way more `kubectl run`
- Tons of YAML
- PodSpec structure is burned into my brain.

## ✅ Learned Secret Encryption with Age 🔐

Secrets management is becoming one of my favorite topics.  
I learned how to encrypt Kubernetes Secrets using **Age** — simple, modern, and elegant.

Final Thoughts

Every step in this journey reinforces one thing:
Learning Kubernetes is not about reading — it’s about building.

Break stuff. Fix stuff. Learn stuff.
