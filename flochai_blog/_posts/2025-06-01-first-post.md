Iâ€™ve decided to document my DevOps learning journey for two reasons:

1. Writing helps me understand concepts better.
2. Maybe my trial and error can save someone else time.

Right now Iâ€™m studying:
- Python for the PCAP 
- Kubernetes to pass the CKA (ouch)
- Infrastructure and system administration (to not suck in Linux)

I'll post short lessons, tools I try, problems I run into, and how I solved them (or why I failed). Thanks for reading â€” and letâ€™s see how far I can go.
