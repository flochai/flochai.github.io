# Flochai.github.io — My DevOps Blog

Welcome to my technical blog! I'm Flo, a DevOps engineer-in-training, documenting my journey from zero to Kubernetes wizard 🧙‍♂️.

🔧 **What I write about:**
- Python scripting
- what breaks my brain (ie pain)
- Kubernetes & containerization (view above)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code
- DevOps culture and productivity
