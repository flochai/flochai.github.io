Hi! Iâ€™m Flo, a DevOps student and tech explorer. I started this blog to hold myself accountable and share what I learn about automation, Kubernetes, Python, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/flochai) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/florian-chaillou-421514355/).
